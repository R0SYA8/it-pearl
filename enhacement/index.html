        <h1>Progressive Enhacement</h1>
        <h3> The first part of the article about progressive enhancement was really understanding it. Progressive Enhancement is basically the progress that each web developer uses to be able to create a website. It is about focusing on the content, not the browsers. There are about three steps to be able to achieve this. The way that you get into that mindset is that you start to think from the content out. The example that was used was an M & M candy. There is the hardshell on the outside that is followed by the chocolate that leads to the center of the M&M which is the peanut. The peanut part is about having the greatest level of detail with all the content and still being able to offer a basic experience to the users. The peanut is the center and most important since one doesn’t want to cause overwhelming. With the Chocolate coating, you want to be able to have a nice CSS to be able to support the content. It can’t get too much into detail like Javascript but just enough to where the CSS helps boost that content and is friendly to everyone. The hard shell is basically the JavaScript thrown into the mix. The hard shell is about providing that experience for the user and being able to bring it all together as one.</h3>

        <h3>The second part of the passage talks about fast load times. When you are building a website you want to be quick but at the same time you want to be efficient. Sometimes from working too fast one doesn’t encounter the mistakes or the performance that is put out there. The article pointed out that taking a step back and looking at the project from afar is good to catch errors or improve certain things. Within the article there are a lot of links that talk about different subjects. The categories are web vitals, optimizing the resource delivery, optimizing the images, lazy loading images and videos, web fonts, optimizing the CSS, and so much more. The article really gives resources that help with seeing if the project needs something different or there is an issue that needs to be fixed.</h3>
