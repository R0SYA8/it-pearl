      <p id="missionstatement2">At OEA, we believe that time spent outdoors is more than just relaxing. We have seen firsthand the confidence-inspring power of the outdoors for those who take the time enjoy it. Regular exposure to activities outdoors has been shown to impact behavior and moods of both the young and young-at-heart. Aside from relieving stress, time spent outside has the potential to lead to improved mental health and clarity, a stronger immune system, and better vision.</p>
